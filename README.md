This is an attendance management project I made with java. The jar should work when you run it, but I only got it to run when in the terminal using: "java -cp T_J_MVC_JBDC_A_M_S-1.0.jar com.aiden.Main" when in the file location. 
Might work differently on other devices. Needs a mysql server running with a database already made, all this does is edit and create tables.
