this is an attendance management project i made with java. the jar should work when ran, but i only got it to dun when in terminal using: "java -cp T_J_MVC_JBDC_A_M_S-1.0.jar com.aiden.Main" when in the file location. 
Might work differently on other divices. Needs a myswl server running with a database already made, all this does is edit and create tables.
